### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a content professional at the intersection of tech, writing, and marketing. On the side, I'm passionate about digital privacy, blockchain tech, cybersecurity, and chess.

I graduated with a degree in computer science and systems engineering and started my career in software testing. But I had no passion for testing and wanted to pivot my career path.

I loved writing in general and decided to make a career out of it. So I started working as a content writer for a small cloud computing company. Since then, my writing career has evolved.

All of this is not to say that writing is an easy endeavor, but the passion for it has kept me going.

Recently, I have discovered that I tend to be a perfectionist about most things I pursue: I have experienced the pros and cons of it. The key is how I channel my perfectionist tendencies to get the best results, though it's neither simple nor easy. 

I try new things from time to time, expand my knowledge, and build new skills.

Even though I have a degree in computer science, I never got serious about programming. But all this education is not for nothing. It helps me understand technical concepts better and consequently write better.

This site you are looking at is built with GatsbyJS. I did a little research on it, cloned a free template from GitHub, and hosted it on GatsbyJS Cloud - all of which went from not knowing it to hosting my site with it in a few hours.

For me, that's what learning is all about: Thinking you can't do something. But after some persistence and failures along the way, you get better and believe in yourself. If anything, learning is an exhilarating experience.

Feel free to get in touch.
